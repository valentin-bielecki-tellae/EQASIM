# Running the Île-de-France MATSim simulation

In order to run a simulation of Île-de-France in MATSIM, you first need
to obtain or [generate a synthetic population](../population/population_summary.md). Afterwards, the
pipeline provides additional stages to create and run a full MATSim scenario
including a digital road and public transport network.
