# Generating the Île-de-France population

The following sections describe how to generate a synthetic population for
Île-de-France using the pipeline. First all necessary data must be gathered.
Afterwards, the pipeline can be run to create a synthetic population in *CSV*
and *GPKG* format. These outputs can be used for analysis, or serve as input
to [run a transport simulation in MATSim](../simulation/simulation_summary.md). Also, this guide
is the basis for creating populations and simulations of other regions and
cities such as [Toulouse](../cases/toulouse.md) or [Lyon](../cases/lyon.md).


This guide will cover the following steps:
